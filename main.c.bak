           1. Send the block number of this block ahead through a function called iterate_over_depth
           2. Inside this function we read the corresponding block for the block number sent.
           3. Next we iterate through the contents of this block, setting the bitmap for each block address we encounter.
           4. In addition to setting the bitmap values for each block address, we also read the corresponding block into a new buffer and test whether this block is a pointer block too. If yes, we call the function iterate_over_depth on this block number, otherwise we dont do anything.

           Okay so now I have a plan to tackle Block Bitmap Recovery which I will be detailing below:
           I will go through every inode in a block group using the values of group_desc_count and use the function 
           ext2fs_inode_scan_goto_blockgroup to place the pointer at the beginning of the inodes in a block group. 
           Then using the ext2fs_get_next_inode I will traverse the whole list of inodes in this block group and when completed 
           move on to the next block group.

           While I am at a particular inode, I need to traverse all the blocks associated with that inode.
           This will be done using the function, ext2fs_block_iterate. This function goes through each block associated with an 
           inode, and calls a function when inside each block.
           Inside this callback function(that will be called inside each block) I will check a few things and take action 
           according to that.
           If I find that the block that I am currently at is a data block, I will test if the block bitmap reflects that this 
           block is being used and has the correct bit set. If not I will do that.
           If I find that the block that I am currently at is a directory block, I will test if the block bitmap reflects that 
           this block is being used and has the correct bit set, if not I will do that.
           If I find that the block that I am currently at is a pointer block, I would have to set the bit for this block in the 
           bitmap. 
           The second thing to do would be to use the iterate over depth function to make sure that all pointers be it direct,
           indirect, double indirect and triple indirect are taken care of using the recursive function that mark all block number
           in a pointer block in the bitmap as being used.
